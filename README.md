# MathWise
MathWise is an Interactive math expression editor with a handwriting recognition system which aims to convert handwritten mathematical expressions to formats that are compatible with formal documentation platforms and provide accurate solutions for the recognized and validated expressions. Based on these recognized math expressions, the aim is to convert these expressions into meaningful formats that can be used for documentation purposes (e.g. LaTeX). The system also attempts to solve the recognized mathematical expression and provide accurate solutions for the same.

The application development is still in progress as we plan to optimize the code and add more features.

## Run the application locally by following these steps:
 1. Clone the Project
 2. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 3. In command prompt, run: npm install 
 4. Launch a local Web server to start using it. Recommended to use [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/install-3-0)
 5. In commonad prompt, run: polymer serve (Application will be hosted on http://localhost:8081/)
